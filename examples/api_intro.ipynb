    "\n",
    "  - run an ephemeral backend, which will forget your data when you exit the backend\n",
    "  - connect to a backend that you run from a terminal or from the MacOS bundled application\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of experimenting with the API, the ephemeral option is much more convenient, so that's what we'll do here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server output is saved in a file, called watchful_ephemeral_output.txt, probably in the same directory you ran the Jupyter notebook command from.\n",
    "This can be useful to look at if anything goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good to be aware that this file contains a complete record of your session, so if you import a lot of data, the file will be correspondingly big, and you might want to delete it to save space.\n",
